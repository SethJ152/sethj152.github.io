This repository hosts a small fallback page that preserves access to SDJ Classroom if the primary URL is filtered or blocked (e.g., by Linewize). The page displays a single CTA linking to the currently working instance; if the main site (sdjclassroom.github.io — checked Sept 8, 2025) becomes unavailable, I’ll update the link here to point to an alternate host. The visual design intentionally matches the main site for continuity. Note: the project began as an EmulatorJS build. The main page is still built on top of EmulatorJS and is a stripped down version.
